# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is trying to fund her Play called "Fever" that has a budget of $10,000. She planning to use crowdfunding campaign. Louise is trying to find out, what steps she should take to ensure that her play is funded. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project to sort, analyze, and visualize data to see of there is a trend and correlation between crowdfunding campaigns that were successful (or failure). 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater shows that are launching April to July have better chances to success than other months. The worse time to launch a show is in December.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
While it may not be very from the graph of percentage failed it could be inferred that higher the goal amount the higher the chances of failure of a campaign. The two point that are exception to this rule falls between $35000 to $45000 are made up of nine projects, that makes less than 1% of total data. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	Sample size campaigns $15000 goal were small. Therefore, the percentage graph in “Outcome based on Goal” does not represent weight of the data. 
-	Other than hard data, quality of the campaign, networking abilities of the mangers, type and popularity of the play, plays role as each play is unique. While it could be quantified, data is not available for those points.  
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- 
            * May and June are the best months to launch theater shows. November and January are the worse months. 
            * Most plays are launched during summertime. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- 
            * Lower the goal amount the higher the chances of success 
            * About 75% of plays have goal of below $5000 with a success rate of about 75%
            * Louise’s campaign has about 50% of change of success at the goal of $10000.  
            * Plays usually do not get canceled.
            * Plays with goal over $20,000 has about 34% chances of success. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- 
            * Not all variables that accounted for. Like play ratings, venue ratings, etc
            * The sample size is limited, especially for plays with higher goals. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-         
            * In “Theatre Outcome by Launch Date” add filter to subcategory and select plays. I tried adding the outcome did change significantly. 
            * Get percentage outcome in “Theatre Outcome by Launch Date” to get full picture. When we look at plays as percentage successful, we get a mean of 60.56% with a standard deviation of 4.59%. There are only three points that are beyond one standard deviation. December is definitely worse with 2.45, while May and June are the best with respectively 1.37 and 1.05 above mean. 
            * A new table for “Outcomes based on Goals” but in Percentiles.  When we graph based on percentile, we see that the goals under 50th percentile have similar chances of success as regardless of amount. However, ratio of success declines rapidly for plays budgeted over $5000.
